Hello! My name is Owen Perry, I'm 19 years old, and I'm an aspiring Game/Web Developer! I'm currently a student at James Madison University pursuing a degree in Computer Science (BS). I've been programming since 2018, mostly in Python, Java, and JavaScript, but I can pick up new languages fairly quick. Alongside that, I've been an avid musician for 13 years, serving as a percussionist in both concert, jazz, and marching settings. Alongside music performance, I truly love to compose! I'm also an avid fan of football, specifically the James Madison Dukes & Minnesota Vikings!
